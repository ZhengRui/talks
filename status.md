# Project Status: Centralized Presentation Hub

*Last Updated: April 14, 2025*

## 1. Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Next.js application with TypeScript setup
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration
- ✅ Base project structure with centralized presentation listing

### Presentation Framework
- ✅ Reveal.js integration with robust initialization handling
- ✅ Navigation between presentations
- ✅ Home page with presentation listing

### Content Creation Methods
- ✅ Server-side rendered MDX slides (`MdxSlide` component)
- ✅ Client-side rendered Markdown slides via reveal.js plugin (`MarkdownSlide` component) 
- ✅ React component slides (direct JSX in page components)

### Architecture
- ✅ Modular component architecture
- ✅ Each presentation in its own directory under `src/app/[slug]`
- ✅ Utility functions for content processing

## 2. In Progress / Partially Implemented

- 🔄 Example presentation (`/example`) demonstrating all slide types
- 🔄 Path resolution for content files (slug-based)

## 3. Not Yet Implemented

- ❌ Three.js integration for 3D graphics in slides
- ❌ Custom slide templates
- ❌ Production-ready presentations (current example is for demonstration)
- ❌ Testing and performance optimization

## 4. Known Issues

- None currently tracked

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Three.js Integration**
   - Create example Three.js component for slides
   - Add support for Three.js canvas resize handling

2. **Custom Templates**
   - Define template structure
   - Implement template selection mechanism  

3. **Content Expansion**
   - Create at least one real presentation
   - Add more styling options
   
4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core components
   - Test across different browsers/devices

## 6. Reference Implementation

Current example at `/example` demonstrates:
- Server-side rendered MDX with embedded components
- Client-side rendered Markdown via reveal.js plugin
- Plain React component slides

Path resolution now supports slug-based relative paths, simplifying slide creation.
